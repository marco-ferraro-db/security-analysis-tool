When a customer runs SAT, it will compare their workspace configurations against a set of security best practices and delivers a report for their Databricks (AWS, Azure, and GCP) workspaces. These checks identify recommendations to harden Databricks configurations, services, and resources. Databricks has worked with thousands of customers to securely deploy the Databricks platform, with the appropriate security features that meet their architecture requirements. While many organizations deploy security differently, there are guidelines and features that are commonly used by organizations that need a high level of security. This tool checks for typical security features that are deployed by most high-security organizations, and reviews the largest risks and the risks that customers ask about most often. It will then provide a security configuration reference link to Databricks documentation along with a recommendation. SAT is a productivity tool to help verify security configurations against security best practices of Databricks, its not meant to be used as a certification or an attestation of your deployments. Please review the SAT report with your business stakeholders, administrators, security team and auditors about SAT report and assess your organizational security requirements before making any security improvements bases on the report, not all deviations required to be mitigated. Some of the recommendations may have cost implications, some of the security features recommended may have dependency feature limitations, please thoroughly review individual feature documentation before making changes to your security configurations. SAT project is being regularly updated to improve correctness of checks, add new checks, fix bugs. Please send your feedback and comments to sat@databricks.com or open a git issue.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Funtionality","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/sat/docs/functionality/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"SAT Insights​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Funtionality","url":"/sat/docs/functionality/#sat-insights","content":" Data across any of the configured workspaces can be surfaced through a single pane of SQL Dashboard which is the primary consumption layer where all the insights are arranged in well defined categories namely:  Network SecurityIdentity &amp; AccessData ProtectionGovernanceInformational  The data in each section is further categorized by severity namely: High, Medium, Low.

Additional Finding Details This section provides additional details that help to pinpoint the source of a security deviation, including the logic used to detect them.

The Deprecated runtime versions check is red indicating that there are runtimes that are deprecated. Workloads on unsupported runtime versions may continue to run, but they receive no Databricks support or fixes. The Remediation column in the screenshot describes the risk and links to the documentation of the Databricks runtime versions that are currently supported.  On the other hand, the Log delivery check is green, confirming that the workspace follows Databricks security best practices. Run these checks regularly to comprehensively view Databricks account workspace security and ensure continuous improvement.    Customers can use the &quot;Additional Details&quot; section to display information on what configuration setting or control failed a specific best practice rule. For example, the image below showcases additional details on the &quot;Deprecated runtime versions&quot; risk for administrators to investigate.
