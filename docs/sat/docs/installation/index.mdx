# Installation

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

* **SAT v0.2.0** or higher brings full support for Unity Catalog. Now you can pick your catalog instead of hive_metastore. Plus, you get to choose your own schema name.

* SAT requires at least one SAT set up in a workspace per **account** in AWS or GCP and at least one SAT set up in a workspace per Azure **subscription**. SAT uses the Service Principal configured with SAT to access and analyze configurations by calling account and workspace APIs. Please make sure to add the Service Principal to the workspaces you wish to analyze as instructed in the setup guides below. SAT running on serverless or classic compute can't analyze account and destination workspaces with IP ACLs configured unless the ACLs are updated to allow access from the SAT workspace. SAT running on Serverless compute can't access other workspaces if the SAT workspace has serverless egress controls configured. In these scenarios, a separate SAT can be configured to analyze the respective target workspace by setting up SAT in that workspace.

* Please make sure to review the SAT report with your business stakeholders, administrators, security team and auditors about SAT report and assess your organizational security requirements before making any security improvements bases on the report, not all deviations required to be mitigated. Some of the recommendations may have cost implications, some of the security features recommended may have dependency feature limitations, please thoroughly review individual feature documentation before making changes to your security configurations.

Follow this guide to setup the **Security Analysis Tool (SAT)** on your Databricks workspace.

## Prerequisites

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

SAT is beneficial to customers on **Databrics Premium** or **Enterprise** as most of the checks and recommendations involve security features available in tiers higher than the Standard.

</Admonition>

Before proceeding with the installation, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Databricks CLI installed with a profile logged (See [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html).)
- Databricks Account ID
- Databricks SQL Warehouse (To run the SQL dashboard)
- Pypi access from your workspace (To install the SAT utility library)



<Admonition type="note" title="Considerations">

SAT creates a new **security_analysis** schema and Delta tables. If you are an existing SAT user please run the following command:

### Hive metastore based schema

```sql
  drop  database security_analysis cascade;
```

### Unity Catalog based schema

```sql
  drop  database <uc_catalog_name>.<schema_name> cascade;
```

</Admonition>

SAT can be setup on any of the cloud providers where Databricks is hosted. Follow the setup guide for the cloud provider you are using:

- [AWS Setup Guide](./standard/aws.mdx)
- [Azure Setup Guide](./standard/azure.mdx)
- [GCP Setup Guide](./standard/gcp.mdx)

<Admonition type="note" title="Terraform Install">

SAT can be setup as Terraform based deployment, if you use Terraform in your organization please prefer Terraform instructions: 


* [SAT AWS Terraform deployment](./terraform/aws.mdx) 
* [SAT Azure Terraform deployment](./terraform/azure.mdx) 
* [SAT GCP Terraform deployment](./terraform/gcp.mdx)
